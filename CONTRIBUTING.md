# Contributing to Umbraco UI

Currently we want to focus on the RFC, when its closed we will open up for contributions.
In this document you can read the future guide for contributions.


## Pull Requests (PRs)

Before you submit a new PR, make sure you run `npm run test`.

### Reviewing PRs

**As a PR submitter**, you should reference the issue if there is one, include a short description of what you contributed and, if it is a code change, instructions for how to manually test out the change.

> NOTE: Although the latest released version of Umbraco UI corresponds to the `main` branch, then development happens in the `v0/dev` branch. If you submit a PR, branch off `v0/dev` and target your PR to `v0/dev`.

## Development Guide


### Best practices for contributing to this library
- Properties should only use attr-reflection for styling - don’t map component-state to classes - use attr-reflection!
- New dependencies can only be added by HQ-team and only after scrutinizing debate (to keep size down)
- Components can’t assume Umbraco context
- Elements shouldn’t depend on TagNames - their own or children - instead use :host or this and use classes/id’s for selection
- Elements always use a shadow-root (shadowDOM - for encapsulation)
- Styles should have as simple rules as possible
- UI-events should be unique types that extend from our UUIEvent (see utils/) (for typing reasons)
- Elements are exported side-effect free (no registration) in the *.element.ts file, and with the registration in the index.ts file

### Before a new element can me merged
- Element name must be prefixed with “UUI-”.
- Element must have tests and pass them.
- Element must pass basic Accessibility tests.
- Element must have a storybook setup.
- Source-code must follow the ES-lint rules.
